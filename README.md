<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p>
<b>IR Simulation</b> is a mobile application built with <b>Flutter</b>, designed to ensure maximum compatibility across platforms.
</p>

<p>
Its main objective is to help <b>Moroccan employees in the private sector</b> calculate their <b>net salary</b> and understand all related <b>deductions</b>.  
By simulating the tax system, the app provides a clearer view of how <b>income tax</b> is applied in Morocco.
</p>

<p>
Currently, the calculation rules are based on <b>older Moroccan tax laws</b>, but the logic will be updated soon to reflect the latest regulations.
