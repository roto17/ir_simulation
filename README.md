IR Simulation is a mobile application built with Flutter, designed to ensure maximum compatibility across platforms.

Its main objective is to help Moroccan employees in the private sector calculate their net salary and understand all related deductions. By simulating the tax system, the app provides a clearer view of how income tax is applied in Morocco.

Currently, the calculation rules are based on older Moroccan tax laws, but the logic will be updated soon to reflect the latest regulations.
